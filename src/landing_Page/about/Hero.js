            We launched Xenova with a mission to simplify and revolutionize
            trading and investing in India. From day one, our goal has been to
            eliminate the barriers that traders face — whether it’s high brokerage
            fees, outdated platforms, or lack of proper support.

            trading platform, trusted by thousands across the country. Backed by

            generation of Indian investors to trade smarter, faster, and with
            full confidence.
